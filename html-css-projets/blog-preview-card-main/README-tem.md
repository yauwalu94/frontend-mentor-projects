# Blog Preview Card ✨

A responsive **Blog Preview Card** built from the [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ckPaj01IcS).  
This project helped me practice **HTML, CSS, Flexbox, and responsive design**.

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to use an **image wrapper** to control spacing without breaking responsiveness:

```css
.card_img_wrapper {
  padding: 20px;
}

.card_img {
  width: 100%;
  display: block;
  border-radius: 10px;
}

- Aligning author avatar and name inline using Flexbox:

.card_avatar {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 0.75rem;
}

- Implemented hover & focus-visible states for accessibility and interactivity.

## 🔧 Continued Development

    Refactor the card as a reusable React component

    Add subtle micro-interactions on hover (scale, shadow)

    Experiment with CSS Grid for multiple card layouts
